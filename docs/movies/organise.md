Adopt movies you already have, tidy file names or remove a movie. Only the owner and admins see these screens.

## Bring in movies you already have

HolyArrs takes over a folder of movies as it is. It moves and renames nothing.

1. Open **Library**, then **Import a library**.
2. Pick a Library folder. If it is not listed, add it on **Settings > Library folders**.
3. Press **Scan**. HolyArrs reads the name and year from each folder and looks the movie up on TMDB.
4. Check the groups:

   | Group | Do |
   | --- | --- |
   | Matched | Nothing. These are ticked for you. |
   | Unsure | Check it, or press **Look up** and search by name, name and year, or `tmdb:123`. Then press **Use this**. |
   | Not matched | Press **Look up** and find the movie. |

   Movies already in the Library, on the Never-add list or without a video file are listed with the reason they are left out.
5. Tick the movies you want and press **Adopt**. The button shows the count, such as **Adopt 3 movies**.

You should see the movies in **Library** with their files present.

A folder name with a TMDB number, such as `Heat (1995) {tmdb-949}`, always matches that movie. When a folder has two or more videos of at least 600 MB, each of those files is its own movie, named from the file. Otherwise the biggest video is the movie, named from the folder. Samples are left out.

This tree adopts cleanly:

```
Movies/
  Heat (1995) {tmdb-949}/
    Heat (1995) Bluray-1080p.mkv
  Dune - Part Two (2024)/
    Dune - Part Two (2024) WEBDL-2160p.mkv
```

## Rename files

1. For one movie, open it and press **Rename files**. For every movie, open **Library**, then **Rename files**.
2. Read the preview: each file's name now and the name it gets.
3. Press **Rename**.

You should see the new names on the movie page. If anything changed since the preview opened, HolyArrs renames nothing and shows a fresh preview.

A rename changes file names only. Folders keep their names. The preview says why it skips a file:

- HolyArrs only found the file on disk and did not import or adopt it.
- Another file already has the new name. HolyArrs never overwrites.
- A link would take the file outside the Library folder.
- The new path is too long.

## Delete a movie

:::caution
**Also delete its files** moves files to the holding folder. HolyArrs removes them for good after 7 days by default.
:::

1. Open the movie and press **Delete**.
2. Read **What will happen**. It updates as you change the options:
   - **Also delete its files** (off). Off, every file stays on disk. On, files HolyArrs imported or adopted move to `.holyarrs-replaced` inside their Library folder. HolyArrs never touches files it only found.
   - **Add it to the Never-add list** (off). Outside lists can then never add the movie again. You can still add it yourself.
3. Confirm.

You should see the movie gone from **Library**. Its history stays. Downloads still running for it stay in the Downloader. Remove them on [Movie downloads](downloads.md#remove-a-download).

## Choices

### Missing files

Once a day HolyArrs checks the Library on disk. A file that disappeared is marked missing, and one that comes back is marked present.

If a whole Library folder is gone, or most of its files vanish at once, HolyArrs warns you and marks nothing missing. This covers a disk that did not mount.

### File names

A colon becomes " - " by default, because Windows and many shares cannot store colons. "Dune: Part Two" is filed as "Dune - Part Two". Change this, and the patterns, under **Settings > Naming and files**.

## If it does not work

**A folder shows as Not matched.**
Fix: add the year or a TMDB number to the folder name, or press **Look up**.

**Many movies suddenly show as missing.**
Cause: the disk or share is not mounted.
Fix: mount it. HolyArrs marks the files present at the next daily check.

**A rename skipped a file.**
Fix: read the reason on the preview. Most often another file already has that name.

**I deleted a movie by mistake.**
Fix: add it again. If you deleted its files, take them back from `.holyarrs-replaced` before the holding days run out.

## For experts

<details class="ha-more"><summary>Settings reference: Settings > Naming and files</summary>

**Where files go**

| Setting | What it does | Default | Change it when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Keep deleted files for (days) | How long deleted or replaced files stay in `.holyarrs-replaced`. 0 never removes them. Maximum 3650. | 7 | You want a longer undo window or need the space. |
| Folders read per library scan | 10 to 100000. A bigger Library shows **Scan the rest**. | 5000 | Scans of a huge Library are slow. |
| Always leave this much free space (MB) | HolyArrs refuses an import that would leave less, before it writes anything. 100 to 1048576. | 100 | Your disk needs more headroom. |
| Skip the free-space check | Turns the check off. | Off | Your disk misreports free space. |

**Movie names**

| Setting | What it does | Default | Change it when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| File name pattern | Text with words in braces, such as `{title} ({year}) {quality}`. Empty words drop out. The example shows the result as you type. HolyArrs cannot save an unknown word. | `{title} ({year}) {quality}` | Your media server wants another layout. |
| Folder name pattern | Same, for folders. Applies to movies added from now on. | `{title} ({year})` | Same. |
| A colon in a name becomes | Replaces the colon. | Smart | You prefer another style. |
| Other characters a disk cannot hold | Swap them for safe ones, or drop them. | Swap | Same. |
| Rename files when they are imported | Off keeps the name the download came with. | On | You rename files yourself. |
